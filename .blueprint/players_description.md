I’m looking for a centre-back profile for FC Barcelona to Join the team.

Since Iñigo Martínez’s departure, the team needs an experienced defender who:

- Can play out from the back under pressure
- Has good passing range and accuracy
- Recovers well when the defensive line is high

Search only in Ligue 1 and LaLiga (Spain) and give me a table with the 10 best matches, including the most important metrics.

Then, write a more detailed scouting report for the top 3 options, explaining (Max 200 words each):

- Why each player fits FC Barcelona’s style of play
- How their stats support that fit
- In what role or game situations they would be most useful for Barça

The output format directly in artifact in MD format.
(Don't give Barcelona players that are already in the squad)

I’m looking for either a right-back or a central-midfield profile for Real Madrid.

Since the current squad lacks a certain type of player, the team needs someone experienced, with strong leadership, high intensity, and a competitive edge. A player who:

- Tackles aggressively and wins duels
- Covers a lot of ground and maintains a high work rate
- Pushes the team forward and influences the pace of play
- Stays highly available both defensively and offensively

Search across the Top 5 ligas (Ligue 1 , LaLiga, Serie A, EPL, Bundesliga) and give me a table with the 10 best matches, including the most important metrics.

Then, write a more detailed scouting report for the top 3 options, explaining:

- Why each player fits Real Madrid’s style of play
- How their stats support that fit
- In what role or game situations they would be most useful for the team
